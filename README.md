# 8tracks Customized Extension

### Overview
8tracks Customized is a Chrome extension to customize various interface
considerations for 8tracks. Currently, the extension supports:
  * Placing the music player bar at the top rather than bottom of the page.
  * Fixing an interaction between 8tracks native js and cVim showtabindices,
    which leads to a stacking of 'â–º' and the tab index.
