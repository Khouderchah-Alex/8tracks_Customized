# 8tracks Customized Extension

### Overview
8tracks Customized is a Chrome extension to customize various interface
considerations for [8tracks](https://8tracks.com). Currently, the extension
supports:
  * Placing the music player bar at the top rather than bottom of the page.
  * Fixing an interaction between 8tracks native js and
    [cVim](https://github.com/1995eaton/chromium-vim) showtabindices, which
    leads to a stacking of 'â–º' and the tab index.
  * Replacing the default youtube links for songs (which doesn't seem to be
    functional) with a link performing a YT query.
